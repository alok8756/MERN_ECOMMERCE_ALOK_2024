## Overview

### Screentshots

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Register and login
- Create cart, address, and order
- Update and delete cart and address, update password, cart, user info, and address
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it



## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com) - Icons
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) - Back-end JavaScript runtime environment
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Nodejs framework

### What I learned

This is my first deployed fullstack application using the MERN stack. As I progressed with this application, I find myself improving a lot and also learnt how to avoid specific mistakes and debug my app better. I believe this project has made it easier for me to make full stack applications better and faster.
